### "Inspiration"
Bubba is a Pubsubhubbub 0.4 spec + some more hub. It borrows liberally from the 0.4 implementations, especially cweiske's Phubb module, and Superfeedr.

### Features
Bubba extends the functionality of the spec, aiming to be a plug and play module, whether you are a subscriber, a publisher, or a hub:

1. Subscribe to any topic/url
	* If the feed publishes to *any PuSH hub*, bubba will subscribe itself to the origin for you and send "fat pings" to you when it gets updates.
	* If the feed doesn't use PuSH, bubba will poll these feeds using min & max frequencies you specify, with exponential backoff. Again, bubba only provides you "fat pings".
	* Bubba checks polled feeds for PuSH usage, meaning if and when they start using PuSH, you're covered.
2. If you went offline but Bubba was online, you can ask it to give you updates since a certain time.    
3. And the usual PuSH features - You can publish your feed to bubba and have your subscribers subscribe to your bubba server directly, and bubba will send them instant updates.

### Installation
Install Instructions - this is meant to be a plug and play module:
1. Install docker on your machine
2. (If installing locally) Setup port forwarding on your machine for to allow Bubba to subscribe to external feeds on your behalf
3. Setup a docker volume for MySQL to use - This should be named MYSQLSTORAGE, or you can change docker-compose.yaml to reflect
4. Alter docker-compose.yaml to enter your own changed settings<br>
5. \`\`\`docker-compose up \`\`\`

### Usage
Publish or Subscribe per PuSH standards. Bubba will do the rest, whether PuSH is actually used or not.
Send a POST request with usual PuSH parameters to **${window.location.href}** to play
